Hi, I'm **Grayson**! 

Welcome to my portfolio website. I am a husband, father, and practicing aerospace engineer who's become quite fascinated with many aspects of finance, particularly quantitative finance. I've created this 
space to host some thoughts on things that preoccupy me. 

Feel free to connect with me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grayson-goble/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">LinkedIn</a>. 

Cheers!
