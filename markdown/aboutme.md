Hi, I'm **Grayson**! 

Welcome to my portfolio website. I am a husband, father, and practicing aerospace engineer who is fascinated by the complex details of fields like **Aerospace Modeling, Simulation, and Control** and **Quantitative 
Finance**. I've created this space to host some thoughts on things that preoccupy me. 

Feel free to connect with me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grayson-goble/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">LinkedIn</a>. 

Cheers!
