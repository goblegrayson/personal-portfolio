Hi, I'm **Grayson**! Welcome to my website. 

I am a husband, father, and practicing aerospace engineer who's become quite fascinated with many aspects of finance, but particularly quantitative finance. I've created this space to host some streams of conciousness on things that preoccupy me. 

If you'd like to chat, feel free to connect with me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grayson-goble/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">LinkedIn</a>. 

Cheers!
